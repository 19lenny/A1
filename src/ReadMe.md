Dear Magnus,

in this code you will find the submission of the assignment 1.

The code was created / written in the IDE IntelliJ. 

All your requirements should be fullfilled. I wrote "fake test cases".
I mean by that, that they are not proper defined test cases, because they work with prints over the terminal.
But they work and you can easy check my work. You will find the test cases in the Main file.

As well I created an UML diagram (project_diagram), to give you an easy to read overview over my code.
The UML diagram is done without getterMethods.

The code and its logic is directly documented in the according methods.
I hope it is easy to read and understand - otherwise feel free to contact me to get a better understanding of my thinking.

All the code can also be found on a git repository:

Best,
Lennart (Jung, lejun22@student.sdu.dk)
